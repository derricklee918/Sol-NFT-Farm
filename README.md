# Solana NFT Farming Program
Welcome to the Solana NFT Farming Program! This decentralized program allows users to stake their SPL tokens, earn points, and redeem those points for exclusive NFTs.

## <i>How It Works</i>
1. Stake SPL Tokens: Users can stake their SPL tokens into the farming pool.
2. Earn Points: As tokens remain staked, users accumulate points over time based on the amount and duration of their stake.
3. Redeem NFTs: Points can be redeemed for unique NFTs directly from the program's NFT collection.

## <i>Features</i>
- Stake & Earn: Stake any SPL token and earn points passively.
- NFT Rewards: Exchange points for rare and exclusive NFTs.
- Fully Decentralized: Built on the Solana blockchain for fast, low-cost transactions.
- Customizable Rewards: Program supports customizable NFT reward tiers based on points earned.

## <i>Setup</i>
To get started, follow the steps below to set up and run the Solana NFT Farming Program.

### Prerequisites
- Solana CLI installed on your machine.
- Rust installed for building the program.
- Node.js and Yarn for front-end interface (if applicable).

### Program Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/derricklee918/Sol-NFT-Farm.git
   cd Sol-NFT-Farm
   yarn install
   ```

2. Run the development server:
```bash
   yarn start
   ```

## <i>Usage</i>

### Staking Tokens
Users can interact with the farming program by sending SPL tokens to the program's staking pool using the front-end interface or directly via Solana transactions. The more tokens staked, the more points a user will accumulate.

### Redeeming NFTs
Once enough points have been earned, users can redeem their points for NFTs. The available NFTs and their point requirements can be displayed in the UI or queried via the program.

### Unstaking Tokens
Users can also unstake their tokens at any time, although this will stop point accumulation.
